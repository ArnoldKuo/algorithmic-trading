> Design a representation
- Real valued chromosomes.
> Define the genotype space
- Stock price (Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close)
- Volume of stock traded
- NASDAQ values - Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close
> Design a way of mapping a genotype to a phenotype
- Percentage change of a metric between previous two days mapped to real valued
  chromosome.
> Design a way of evaluating an individual
- Start with a simple model and move to more complex model.
- Percentage change of any of the 3 non-stock price related metrics has positive
  change and the percentage of 3 stock price related metrics has positive change
  results in a positive change of at least 0.5% of the stock price for the next trading day. 
  (Same metrics apply for negative changes)
> Design suitable mutation operator(s)
- Take average with uniform noise between [-1, 1]
> Design suitable recombination operator(s)
- Mean of two parents (local recombination - different metrics recombine among
  themselves)
> Decide how to select individuals to be parents
- Fitness proportionate
> Decide how to select individuals for the next generation (how to manage the
population)
- Best 50% of individuals. (Might change in the future based on the diversity
  acheived)
> Decide how to start: initialization method
- Initialize population with the given data.
> Decide how to stop: termination criterion
- Error rate is less than 1e-8.
